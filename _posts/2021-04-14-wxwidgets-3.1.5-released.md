wxWidgets 3.1.5 release is now
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/tag/v3.1.5).
You will find there archives with the library sources and documentation as
well as binaries for the selected Windows compilers such as [Microsoft Visual
C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [MinGW-w64](https://mingw-w64.org/)
and [TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/).

Please notice that while 3.1.5 is officially a "development" version because
it is not fully compatible with the "stable" 3.0.x, the list of backwards
incompatible changes is very short, so you shouldn't have any problems
updating to this version from 3.0.x in practice, and you're encouraged to use
this release, including in production.

### Changes in this release

In the nine months since the previous release, there have been more than 1600
commits from 70 unique contributors (40 with multiple contributions), so it is
impossible to summarize all the changes in this document without making it too
long, please see the [fuller changelog][1] for more (but still not all)
details, but some of the most important changes are:

  and HTTP/2 from wxWidgets applications using native libraries or libcurl.

- API additions: wxPersistentComboBox, wxFileName::ResolveLink(),

- Improvements: wxConfig now supports 64-bit integers, wxLog uses millisecond

Notice that in spite of all the changes, this release remains almost completely
compatible with 3.1.4 at the API level, so upgrading to it if you're already
using wxWidgets 3 should be straightforward.
